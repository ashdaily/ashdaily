### Hey, I'm Ashish! I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer living in Tokyo, Japan. Born and raised in North India, I moved to Tokyo shortly after finishing university education to start my career as a Software Engineer. 

### In my spare time, I work on a hobby project, [Turbocommerce](https://github.com/ashdaily/turbocommerce), an open source e-commerce solution similar to shopify. 

### Some of the prophecies that have helped me become better at software engineering:

- Do one thing, and do it well.
- Done is better than perfect.
- Always find the root cause of the problems.
- Do not shy away from reading source code of dependencies.
- Write for flexibility.
- Write good test coverage.
- Build to distribute.
- Always keep refactoring code.
