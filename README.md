### Hey, I'm Ashish! I'm a Software Engineer at Bizmobile in Tokyo, Japan. Born and raised in North India, I moved to Tokyo shortly after finishing university education in 2016 to start my career as a Software Engineer. 

### I have worked with variety of technologies like c/c++/python/django/js/typescript/jquery/reactjs/reactnative/html/css/aws/docker. I aspire to become better at backend engineering and keep learning new things related to c/c++, python, linux, aws, sql/nosql databases etc.

### For the first two and a half years in my career I worked on an IoT app that collected data from several casino machines in Japan and showed real time slot/pachinko machine data in ios/android apps. 

### Recently I have been working on Entreprise Apple Mobile Device Management software that helps businesses manage their Apple devices such as iPhone, Macbooks, iPad, Apple TV etc. 

### In my spare time, I work on a hobby project, [Turbocommerce](https://github.com/ashdaily/turbocommerce), an open source e-commerce solution similar to shopify. 


### Some of the prophecies that have helped me become better at software engineering:

- Do one thing, and do it well.
- Done is better than perfect.
- Always find the root cause of the problems.
- Do not shy away from reading source code of dependencies.
- Write for flexibility.
- Write good test coverage.
- Build to distribute.
- Always keep refactoring code.
